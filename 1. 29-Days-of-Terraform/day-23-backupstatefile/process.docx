rm.tfstate : the primary statefile that terraform uses to track the current statefile
rm.tfstate.backup : an automatically created backup of the state file by terraform itself
kept in the same directory for saftey during updates


my issue are  there with the current state you can switch to previous state with the help of backup file 
mv terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate
